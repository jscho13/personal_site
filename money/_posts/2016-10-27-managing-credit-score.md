Credit scores are an important tool for determining your qualification and interest rates on loans. It could mean thousands of dollars in savings. Whenever you make a major financial decision, like buying a house or getting a new car, your credit score will be part of the picture.

### Credit Score Factors

If you have a debt of $500 and a credit limit of $1000 ($500/$1000), your credit limit is 50%. Creditors like to see a utilization less than 35%.

2. Apply aggressively for credit cards if you haven't had any recent hard inquiries.

Credit increases are good for two reasons. A. They lowers your utilization ($500/$1000 vs $500/$1500) B. It's not considered a hard pull.

Applying aggressively helps because older credit cards translate directly to longer credit history. These cards typically don't shut down if you use them once a year. Remember, having too many credit pulls within a two year period impacts your score.
