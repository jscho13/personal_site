### What's A Credit Score Good For?
A credit score is a number used by lenders to determine how "dependable" you are compared to an average. Banks, credit card companies, and dealerships are all examples of lenders we work with everyday. If you have a good credit score you get can offers to improved loans and interest rates. For example, when shopping for a mortgages, purchasing a car, or applying for a credit card, your score is a key part of the picture. A strong credit score could be the difference between thousands to ten thousands of dollars in savings!

### Credit Score Factors
There are different factors used to calculate credit score depending on the company, but FICO is the most common model so it's an obvious place to begin. Interestingly, FICO credit scores essentially have a monopoly the credit score market. <a href="https://www.cafecredit.com/credit-score-range/" rel="nofollow"> Other </a>metrics exist but are used less often.

The FICO credit score <a href="http://www.myfico.com/credit-education/whats-in-your-credit-score/" rel="nofollow">factors</a> are as follows:
* Payment history - (35%)
* Amounts owed (Credit utilization) - (30%)
* Length of credit history (15%)
* Amount of New Credit/Inquiries (10%)
* Credit mix (10%)

Notice that paying your bills on time has the most impact to your credit score! There's no true quick fix to credit scores except for responsibility and time. Forgetting to foot the bill is a double whammy of additional fees and credit damage. If you have enough in an account to use automatic payments, it can go a long way in ensuring timely payment.

### Credit Utilization
The second largest influence to credit rating is your amounts owed, also known as credit utilization. Utilization is calculated by the the total debt owed vs current credit limit. For example, lets say we have a total debt of $2,000 and a credit limit of $8,000. Division tells us our credit utilization is 25%.

In general creditors like to see a credit utilization less then 35%, since anymore could indicate there's heavy debt.

### Gaming the System
Luckily for us there's trick we can use to tip this calculation process in our favor. We can either pay off more of our total debt, or increase our limit to lower credit utilization. While requesting credit limit increases is simple the trick is to understand when:

1. If you've had a credit card for a year or more, simply ask for a credit limit increase. Companies are generally willing to increase limits once you've developed history with them, or if you report an increase in salary. Note that credit limits can be drawn back if they go unused for too long. Generally I try to use each credit card at least once a year.

2. Apply for new cards if you haven't had any hard pulls within the past year. Having too many hard inquiries can be a red flag to creditors, because there is a proven correlation between hard pulls and credit risk.

Credit increases are good because it can serve as a buffer for credit utilization. Additionally, by owning several credit cards we gain traction for a good credit mix. Having a mix of cards, loans, and mortgages tells lenders we're responsible creditors.

Too many hard pulls can indicate someone is shopping around for credit. After a year hard inquiries no longer affect your credit score, and after two they drop off your credit report completely. And in case you were wondering, soft inquiries (soft pulls) don't affect your credit score at all!

### The Caveats to Keep In Mind
Keeping aggressive with credit applications early on especially helps because positive credit history directly translates to a higher score. Income increases indicate a higher spending capacity so don't forget to report them. We also know that applying to too many cards will bring your score down. A general rule of thumb is to limit hard pulls to two within a one year period.

Having a solid grasp on credit important, but it's also important to [budget](http://brunchbucks.com/budget/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/) existing money as well. I've noticed that in a way the two go hand in hand. Credit is all about leveraging future spending, while budgeting is what controls current spending.
