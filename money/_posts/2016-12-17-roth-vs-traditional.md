Retirement. For most twenty year olds it's a concept that's still far off their radar, but investing early on can lead to massive gains overtime because of compound interest. To get an idea, check out the image below with an estimated annual rate of return of 5% yearly.

It's clear to see that the true power of compound interest lies in its exponential gains. To maximize your financial growth early action is a must.

### 401k and IRAs in a nutshell
401k's are a retirement savings plan that is sponsored by an employer. They are tax-deferred, which means you don't pay taxes on them before putting them into the account. These pension accounts have a yearly cap of $18,000 as of 2016. If you're over the age of 50 that limit goes up to $24,000.

IRAs are similar in that they are a retirement savings account, but they are not employer sponsored. Thus the name Independent Retirement Account (IRA). While useful, IRA's unfortunately much lower max limit of $5,500. If you're a senior citizen you can add an extra grand for a $6,500 yearly maximum contribution. An interesting caveat to the traditional is you can't make contributions after age 70 1/2.

Keep in mind that both 401k and IRAs tax deductions change depending on marriage status. Below is a great summary of the IRA Deduction rules for traditional accounts.

### Roth's
Roth 401k's are similar in that they are a retirement savings plan. However, they are not tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes before putting money into the account. Since taxes are paid beforehand, Roth 401k's have a lower limit of $5,500 as of 2016. If you're a senior over 50 the limit increases to $6,500. Roth IRA's also have a limit of $5,500. Similar to the other accounts you get another $1,000 once you become a senior citizen.

Roth's are sweet because you gain a tax-free stream of income in retirement, as well as more flexibility because you can continue to contribute after 70 1/2. A downside is that they offer no tax deductions, meaning all money in Roth's are considered part of your annual gross income.

### Which one should I pick?
There are pros and cons to both accounts, both of which balance each other out.

A common factor in determining which account to purchase is age. If you're younger and believe your salary will go up, it's better to pay taxes ahead of time for a Roth 401k. This typically works best for people around 25 years old since they aren't at their peak earning years. Once you have a higher salary you're placed in a higher tax bracket, meaning there will be proportionally more taxes.

Keep in mind you can contribute to both accounts. In an ideal situation you'd like to hit the contribution maximum for both accounts. You've also probably noticed that both accounts offer some sort of tax benefit that supplements the other. Having a mix of accounts is key to properly [diversify your portfolio][diversify-portfolio]. Furthermore, if you hit the limits of both accounts also consider an [IRA and Roth IRA][iras].
