We all know it's a good idea to save money, but a lot of us have trouble actually keeping money where it's supposed to be!

It's hard enough to put aside money while juggle bills, going out, and buying necessities. Have you ever portioned away cash that was intended for savings, but by the end of the month it all evaporated into thin air? Me too. People are fickle things, and simple saying you're going to do something doesn't always make it happen.

I'm a firm believer that if you want to deeply change your behavior, you first have to change how you think. A key mindset for successful savings is understanding that "saving money is the same as spending money."

### But wait, how's that possible?
By saving money you're really spending money on your future. Put in other words, cash that has been saved **is not** the same as unspent cash. Unfortunately many people mix the two, and think that saving money is the same as unspent money. Let's look at some examples where this mindset commonly manifests itself.

Shoppers often fall into this mindset trap when they see big discounts on expensive items. Let's say theres a new pair of Nike's you've been itching to buy for months. At first release the price tag is a whopping $300! Being the clever spender you are, you stave off purchasing them until they drop to a much more affordable $200. From there it's easy to think, wow I saved myself $100! But deep inside we all know the reality is that we spent $200 more compared to buying no shoes at all.

Another tactic used by shopping malls is buy two get one free "inventory sales". Just because you received three pairs of pants for the price of two doesn't mean money was saved. In fact, studies show that sales tactics like these push people to buy an extra article of clothing they ordinarily wouldn't buy. It's no surprise that holiday season is one of the most profitable sales period for retail stores despite yearly Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas discounts. Vendors prey on the belief that saving money and directly translates to unspent money.

### Some immediate actions
To really translate discounts into savings, try taking the money saved and putting it into your savings. The $100 you just saved on shoes? Intentionally move that cash into your savings account where you're less likely to touch it. The third pair of jeans you received? Act like you paid for the those jeans anyway and stash it away.

There's a lot of wisdom in the words "time is money". Try to think of savings as **putting money now, into the future.** In essence, spending money now for potential gains in the future in any form is the same concept as making an investment! Conversely, **spending money from the future, for now** is the same as tapping into your credit.

By adopting the mindset that saving money is spending money, things like creating a [zero-based budget](http://brunchbucks.com/moneymanagement/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/) become significantly easier. I believe this happens because it forces us to limit the amount of spending moeny we have. Imagine picking up a box of chocolates with the intent of only eating one or two chocolates. Instead of the box being almost empty, you pleasantly realize you actually have an abundance of chocolate! You happily grab a handful since you have extra to spare.

Savings can operate in the same way. With today's online banking it's easy to check your account balance at the click of a button. If I have some extra padding in the checkings account, I noticed I have a tendency to spend more. Shifting money into a savings account and not touching it can work wonders. When you treat saved money as spent money, it becomes much easier to limit yourself from using it in the future.
