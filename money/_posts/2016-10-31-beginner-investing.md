### Where Should I Invest My Money?
A big barrier to investing for most people is that there are too many places to start. What do the terms mean, what do they do, what are the differences? I'm here to make your life easier and tell you exactly what you need to buy, Vanguard Funds.

Vanguard Funds consistently outperform any managed or active fund for two main reasons:
- They have lower management fees.
- They trade much less, so turnover ratio is lower.


Comparing index funds to mutual funds often times will make them look favorable. Don't forget, there are some horrible mutual fund managers out there. It makes sense to check their histories before you purchase any of their shares. Even if you find a good fund manager, they can easily switch over to another portfolio and leave you in the dust.

### You Get Exactly What You Don't Pay For
John C. Bogle is an investor arguably as talented as Warren Buffet within the investment community. He has a famous quote that hits hard on how important it is to have lower management fees.
> You get exactly what you don't pay for.

A Vanguard Fund has a yearly fee of 0.07%, lets say you find a fund that goes for 1.32%. 1.25% isn't so big of a deal right?

Wrong, it amounts to 27% of your retirement savings going to someone for no reason. It's because not only are you losing your money to fees, you're also losing on the potential returns of that money. On top of that don't forget a majority of mutual funds can't outperform the market.

### Next Steps
Skip the fees and start investing into Vanguard funds now. Once you've got your first bit of money invested and you're ready to take another step, learn more about the importance of [diversifying your portfolio][diversifying-portfolio].
