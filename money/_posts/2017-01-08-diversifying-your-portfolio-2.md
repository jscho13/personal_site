Earlier on we talked about the importance of [diversifying your portfolio](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2016/11/21/diversifying-your-portfolio.html) with stocks and bonds. Digging a little bit deeper there are other opportunities to diversify your portfolio through different company sizes, industries, and location.

### Types of Diversification
In [early investing](http://brunchbucks.com/investment/2016/11/01/early-investing/) we covered the benefits of investing in index funds vs actively managed funds by looking at Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index [(VTSMX)](http://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=VTSMX){:rel="nofollow"}. Lets take a look at the Vanguard 500 Index Fund [(VFINX)](http://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=VFINX&region=usa&culture=en_US). As you may be able to guess from the name, a fund that instantly diversifies your portfolio across the 500 largest companies in America. Isn't that nice?

There are some limitations with this fund however. Taking a look at [(VFINX)](http://www.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/VFINX/quote.html) reveals that this fund is composed 99% of U.S. stock, all of which are large companies.

There are two main problems with this if it represented our entire portfolio:

- The weighted average of holdings is too skewed. Different sized companies also have a share of the action. Company sizes can range from micro, small, medium, large, to giant. Even among the varying sizes there are core, value and growth funds.

- The asset allocations are off. While the U.S. is a good investment because it's generally growing, not all of the action is domestic. Investing in international stocks helps balance out portfolios if the domestic value drops and international assets grow.

### Different Market Caps
Balanced portfolios covers small, medium, and large companies alike, all with their own risks and indicated by the y-axis of the style map. Funds that contain mostly small-cap suffer greater losses during market volatility. Less-established companies tend to go out of business when the market is rough. On the other hand, large cap funds are more stable and are great for us since we can simply "buy and hold" the shares. For younger investors who can take more risk, this can lead to fewer potential returns.

The x-axis of the style map has label holdings. These can be value, core, and growth holdings. Value holdings are stocks that fund managers believe are undervalued by the market. Buying these stocks are anticipated to pay off in the future when they rise to their proper value, but could also be undervalued for long periods of time. Growth holdings are holdings that managers believe to be ready for growth. While these stocks are anticipated to grow quickly, they are also more volatile relative to other stocks and could rapidly decrease in value.

The trend between the two is straightforward. Value propositions are safer but have lower returns, and growth propositions have higher potential but carry more risk. Last are core propositions. A core fund simply focuses on a mixture of growth and value stocks so that it can't be accurately categorized as either. Core funds are our ideal because their diversification balances between risk and return. The drawback for core funds is that while diversification helps mitigate risk, it does not ensure profit or guarantee against loss.

### Adding International Stocks
There is still discussion on what a proper distribution between domestic and international stocks should be. One thing that is for sure is to have some of your portfolio designated to international stocks. A good Vanguard fund to begin with is Vanguards Total International Stock Index Fund.

It makes sense to purchase 1/3 domestic stocks, 1/3 international stocks, and 1/3 U.S. bonds for a simple three-fund portfolio. Three-fund portfolios are perfect for younger investors because they are considered [lazy portfolios](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios){:rel="nofollow"}. They are designed to do well in most markets, contain few funds so they are easy to rebalance, and have 30%-40% bonds.

Other portfolios such as Vanguards Target Retirement funds portion 40% of the stocks as international, and the other 60% as domestic. Now that we know about the different types of diversification, we can look deeper into Vanguard Target Retirement funds to understand why they're made, and how they do most of the legwork for you.
