During the beginning steps to financial freedom it can be tough to get a strong grasp of your personal finances. There's no all-encompassing "correct" budget out there, but with time and attention you can begin to craft a budget that fits your needs the best.

There are many ways to begin building a budget, but all effective budgets share one trait: zero-based budgeting.

### Zero-Based Budgeting in a Nutshell
Zero-based budgeting is a method that gives every dollar you earn a purpose. To start you need two numbers:

* Your total income (the total amount of money you earn)
* Your total expenses (the sum of your spendings, including [saved money](http://brunchbucks.com/budget/2016/12/10/saved-money-is-spent-money.html))

Lets say you make $2,000 a month. To make your money work for you all of that cash needs to be assigned a task. Note that for a proper zero-based budget its imperative to keep proper track of expenses. Rent, groceries, cash purchases, and other investments can be tough to keep track of, so I highly recommend a tools like Mint help keep track.

### Why's it useful?
While it's possible to respect your budgets limit it's significantly easier to squander unfocused money. When 100% of the cash is delegated a task, we become less likely to go over a particular budgeted category. When I used to set arbitrary limits on categories, I noticed I would frequently over spend anyways. Money would continue to pour into concert tickets, alcohol, and entertainment activities even after I hit my limit. Looking back, this happened because I knew I could safely get away with spending just a bit extra.

Without a zero-based budget you end up with an extra padding that tempts everyone to go over the limit, and any potential savings from unassigned income can quickly evaporate. Once I delegated my unbudgeted income towards productive outlets such as [IRA's](http://brunchbucks.com/retirement/2016/12/17/roth-vs-traditional/) or [mutual fund investments](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2016/11/01/early-investing.html), I noticed I started to consistently hit my budget. 

There are studies that show zero-based budgeting can lead to a double whammy of paying off debt faster, and saving more money! It's clear creating a zero-based budget goes a long way towards paving a stable financial future.

### So now what?
Once you've gathered your income from all sources, whether it be from work, side gigs, or another business, decide how much you want to spend in different categories. Here's a sample budget that I used to get started:

- Rent - $1,300
- Transportation - $200
- Utilities - $200
- Food and Dining - $700
- Credit card payments - $200
- Nest egg - $100
- Retirement fund - $100
- Family help - $400
- Entertainment and Shopping - $500

Notice how **every dollar is delegated a job**. Even a minute amount such as $30 left over needs to be assigned to a specific category. Don't stress on getting the numbers right the first time, what's more important is to outline a financial game plan that you can adapt. An initial general estimate is nice because as you gather more spending history, your estimations will become more exact.

If you already have a budget in place take some time to give it another look. Are there any gaps? Are there places that need tweaking? If you're not sure where to place leftover money the job isn't finished. Some common options are savings accounts, 401k's, and IRA's, or building a nest egg.

Creating an initial plan for [your first budget][building-a-budget] can seem intimidating, but don't worry. Improving your budget whenever you go over/under is part of an ongoing process. One last note to keep in mind is that while budgeting initially feels constricting, it gradually becomes liberating. When you're progressing with your budget you become aware of when you can afford to splurge money or tighten up your purse. It allows for the freedom of guilt free spending.
