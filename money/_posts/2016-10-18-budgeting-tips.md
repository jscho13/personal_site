During the beginning steps to financial freedom it can be tough to get a strong grasp of your personal finances. There's no all-encompassing "correct" budget out there, but with time and attention you can begin to craft a budget that fits your needs the best.

There are many ways to begin building a budget, but all effective budgets share one trait: zero-based budgeting.

### Zero-Based Budgeting in a Nutshell
Zero-based budgeting is a method that assigns every dollar you earn, a purpose. To start you need two numbers.

* Take the total amount of money you earn
* Make the total amount of money you spend (this includes [saved money](http://brunchbucks.com/budget/2016/12/10/saved-money-is-not-unspent-money.html)) equal to that

If you make $4,000 a month all of your cash flow needs to go into something. Note that for a proper zero-based budget its critical to keep proper track of your expenses, whether it be rent, groceries, investments, or various savings accounts. I highly recommend a tool like Mint or YNAB to keep track. It's a foundational element in making a budget that stays focused and to the point.

### Why's it useful?
A common mental trap with unfocused money is that it doesn't necessarily convert to savings. While it's possible to respect your budgets limit, it's easy to squander unbudgeted money. Personally, I noticed myself primed to spend more money in a category (let's say dining out) even after I hit my limit of $400. I believe this happens because I know I can safely get away with spending extra.

When there's extra padding it can be tempting to go over the limit, and money that could have been saved will quickly evaporate. However, once I delegated my unbudgeted income and put it towards [investments](http://brunchbucks.com/investment/2016/11/01/early-investing/), I found myself consistently hitting budget. There are studies that show zero-based budgeting can lead to a double win of paying off more debt, and saving more money! Creating a zero-based budget today goes a long way to paving a stable financial future. It's important to make your money work for you.

### So now what?
To properly create a zero-based budget gather all the sources of your annual income, whether it be from work, side gigs, or another business.

From there **delegate every dollar** to a job. Even if there's $50 left over assign it to a specific category like Transportation or Entertainment. Don't stress on getting the numbers exactly right, as long as you have a general estimate. As more time passes and you accumulate more spending history it will become easier to assess how much you'll spend.

If you already have a budget take time now to give it a look over for any gaps. Are there places where you've spent more or spent less? Not sure what to do with hard saved money? The job isn't finished. Some common options are a savings account, building your nest egg, 401k's, and IRA's.

> There's a big difference between unfocused money and money that goes straight towards savings.

Creating an initial plan for [your first budget][building-a-budget] can seem intimidating, but going over and under (if you're lucky!) budget always happens. A last note is that while budgets initially seem constricting in how much you spend, they gradually become liberating. Once you start to follow your budget you won't feel guilty for occasionally splurging since you know it's within your limits.
