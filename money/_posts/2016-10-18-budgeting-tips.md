### Zero-Based Budget
Zero-based budgeting is where you give every dollar a job. That means the total you earn is the total you spend. It's one of the key tricks to create a budget that stays focused.

A common mental trap is that unfocused money turns into money saved. While it's possible to respect your budgets limit, it's easy to squander unbudgeted money. I found myself primed to spend even after going over budget when all of my money wasn't. Saving money can be difficult, and you may find the money you meant to save turn into extraneous spending money.

In my early 20's I made the critical mistake of not giving every dollar a job. I would tell myself it's okay to spend a bit outside of my means since I had a little cash padding anyways. Splurging on concert tickets, alcohol, and smokes became justified. Overnight money that could should have gone into my savings would evaporate. Once I slimmed down my spending and put it towards better [investments][investing-money], I found myself consistently hitting my budget.

### So now what?
Take time now to assess your budget and look at any gaps. Are there places you've where you spend more and or spend less? Not sure what to do with hard saved money? The job isn't finished. Some common options are a savings account, building your nest egg, and 401k/IRA's.

Going over and under (if you're lucky!) budget always happens. But making sure all of your money is going to a specific place does a lot towards building wealth.
