Earlier in [IRA's](http://brunchbucks.com/retirement/2016/12/17/roth-vs-traditional/) we covered the advantages of independent retirement accounts. They offer a range of tax benefits whether you choose Roth or Traditional. Congratulations to those who are ready to begin investing in an IRA! There's a wide variety of options you can choose from but a majority of investors begin with no-load mutual funds because of their low expense ratios. Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard are all popular no-load mutual funds that have solid reputations.

For sake of simplicity we'll be comparing 2055 Target Funds across our three choices. The reason we're comparing [target funds](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2017/01/09/target-funds.html){:rel="nofollow"} is for two main reasons. Target retirement funds have been growing rapidly popularity, and provide an easy one-stop solution for investors who don't want to spend too much time researching investments.

### Fidelity
Our first fund is Fidelity's Freedom Index 2055 Fund [FFDEX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315793851){:rel="nofollow"}. It has an expense ratio of 0.77%, and a minimum of $2,500 to begin investing. As one would expect from a portfolio that has a high tolerance for risk, the Freedom Index 2055 Fund is heavy in stocks. It's composed of 65% domestic stocks, 30% international stocks, and 5% bonds. Additionally, it boasts the most diverse portfolio the three with shares in 25+ different funds.

### T.Rowe Price
T.Rowe Price offers the T.Rowe Price Retirement 2055 Fund [TRRNX](http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/snapshot.do?ticker=TRRNX){:rel="nofollow"} as their signature target fund. Relative to Fidelity it carries a slightly smaller expense ratio of 0.76%, but the difference between the two is barely significant. A nice strength of T.Rowe Price is that the minimum account balance to open an IRA is $1,000. This makes a significantly lower barrier to investing for beginners. Similar to Fidelity, it totals 17 different funds in a diverse range of holdings. It's 60% domestic stock, 30% foreign stock, and 10% bonds. While a slightly safer portfolio relative to Fidelity, this fund still maintains a high stock to bond ratio because it's aimed at younger investors.

### Vanguard
The final portfolio is Vanguards Target 2055 Retirement Fund [(VFFVX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1487&FundIntExt=INT#tab=0){:rel="nofollow"}. It has the lowest expense ratio of the three lying at 0.16%. Similar to T.Rowe Price it has a low account minimum of $1,000, making it easier for those who are making their first large investment purchase. Taking a look into the portfolio we can see it is also the simplest fund consisting of 4 different funds. I suspect the simplicity of the portfolio plays a large part in the low expense ratio. The portfolio is 55% domestic stocks, 35% international stocks, and 10% bonds. Vanguard has the highest share of foreign stocks relative to other popular choices. In general, portfolios tend to be more domestic heavy.

### Verdict
The table below provides a boiled comparison among the three mutual funds based off of account minimums and expense ratios.

In terms of pure numbers the clear financial winner is Vanguard. The combination of a low account minimums and low expense ratios makes it easy to begin investing while ensuring the best bang for buck. Low expense ratios are a double whammy of less money being shelled out to funds, and more money to invest! On the other hand, Vanguard is weaker in the diversification of it's portfolio. It consists of a limited amount of funds and is more international heavy compared to other portfolios.
