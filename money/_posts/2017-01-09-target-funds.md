[Part one](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2016/11/21/diversifying-your-portfolio.html) and [part two](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2017/01/08/diversifying-your-portfolio-2.html) cover the importance of mixing up our portfolios. Target Funds have been growing in popularity quickly, and were made with the intention to remove the ongoing work of rebalancing and diversification. Instead, these portfolios rebalance themselves every year. Let's take a took look at Vanguard's Target Retirement 2055 [(VFFVX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1487&FundIntExt=INT#tab=2){:rel="nofollow"} fund and see how it's structured.

If we tally up the percentages, we notice stocks take about 90% of the portfolio, and bonds take about 10%. Going with our 120-age rule we can estimate this portfolio is best geared towards 30 years olds. Using todays year of 2017 a retiree at 2055 would be approximately 68 years old. This explains the reasoning between the stock and bond percentages.
