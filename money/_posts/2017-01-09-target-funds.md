[Part one](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2016/11/21/diversifying-your-portfolio.html) and [part two](http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2017/01/08/diversifying-your-portfolio-2.html) of "Diversifying Your Portfolio" cover the importance having a strong asset mix. In this article we're going to cover "Target Funds", funds which have been quickly growing in popularity. They were made to ease the pain of ongoing rebalancing and maintaining proper diversification. Let's take a took look at Vanguard's Target Retirement 2055 [(VFFVX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1487&FundIntExt=INT#tab=2){:rel="nofollow"} fund to see how it's structured.

### Target Retirement 2055 Breakdown
The Target Retirement 2055 is a fund that invests in four other funds. Below is a breakdown of the fund name and their corresponding percentages.
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Fund</th>
    <th>Percentage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares</td>
    <td>54.1%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares</td>
    <td>35.8%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Investor Shares</td>
    <td>7.1%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Investor Shares</td>
    <td>3.0%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Notice how stocks take around 90% of the portfolio and bonds 10% if we tally up the percentages. We can estimate this portfolios target demographic if we calculate with the 120-age rule. With the 120-age rule a portfolio with 90% stocks has a risk tolerance matching a 30 years old. At 2055 we would be at 65 years old, an age where many people being to consider retirement. Target funds automatically rebalance this percentage as time progresses.

Looking from a purely domestic vs international standpoint, domestic holdings take up 60% and international holdings take up the other 40%. While the ratio of domestic to international stocks is still up for contention, common opinion rarely recommends more international stocks than domestic.

### Target Retirement 2020 Breakdown
Let's take a look at a retirement fund that's much closer. The Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 fund is composed of 60% stocks. While using the 120-age rule we recognize this portfolio anticipates retirement in the 60's. [(VTWNX)](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0682&FundIntExt=INT){:rel="nofollow"}

The other 40% rest of the portfolio is bonds. The reason for this is older investors have a lower risk tolerance. Stocks which are more volatile have a higher chance of losing their value and blowing away any savings. While bonds have lower potential returns, they are also a safer investment.

Analyzing this portfolio from a geographic standpoint, 65% of is domestic, and 35% is international. It's interesting that there's a lower percentage of international holdings relative to domestic. It's clear Vanguard prefers domestic holdings.

There's a third category introduced in this fund called Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund Investor Shares [(VTIPX)]([https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1967&FundIntExt=INT]){:rel="nofollow"}. Essentially the funds income changes according to interest rates and change in inflation. Since it's designed to generate returns closely correlated with realized inflation it doesn't generate significant returns, but is a safe way to curb against unexpected inflation (inflationary surprises).
