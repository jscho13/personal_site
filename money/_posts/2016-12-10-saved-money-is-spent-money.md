We all know it's a good idea to save money, but a lot of us have trouble actually keeping money where it's supposed to be!

It's hard enough to put aside money while juggling bills, going out, and buying necessities. Have you ever portioned away cash that was intended for savings, but by the end of the month it all evaporated into thin air? Me too. People are fickle things, and simply saying you're going to do something doesn't always make it happen.

I have a firm belief that if you want to deeply change your behavior, you first need to change how you think. A savings orientated mindset is understanding that "saving money is the same as spending money."

### But wait, how's that possible?
Try to think of saving money as spending money on the future. Put into other words, cash that has been saved **is not** the same as unspent cash. Unfortunately many people mix the two, and think that saved money is the same as unspent money. Let's look at some examples where this mindset manifests itself.

Shoppers fall for a common sales trap when they see big discounts on expensive items. Let's say there's a new pair of designer shoes you've been itching to buy for months. At first release the price tag is a whopping 200 bucks! Being the smart saver you are, you stave off purchasing them until they drop to an affordable $150. From there it's easy to think, wow I saved myself $150. However, the reality is that we still spent $150 more then spending no money at all.

Another tactic used by shopping malls are "buy two get one free" inventory sales. Just because you received three pairs of pants for the price of two doesn't mean money was saved. Similar to our shoe example, money was spent compared to spending nothing at all. Studies have shown that sales tactics like these push people to buy an extra article of clothing they ordinarily wouldn't buy. It's no surprise that holiday season is one of the most profitable sales period for retail stores despite yearly Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas discounts. Vendors prey on the belief that unspent money directly translates savings.

### Some immediate actions
To really translate discounts into savings, try taking money saved and putting it into savings. The $150 discount you received on your shoes? Deliberately move that cash into your savings account where you're less likely to touch it. The third pair of jeans you received? Act like you paid for the those jeans anyway and stash it in another account.

There's a lot of wisdom in the words "time is money". Try to think of savings as **spending money now, for the future.** In essence, spending money now for potential gains in the future is the same concept behind making an investment! Conversely, **spending money from the future, for now** is the concept behind tapping into your credit.

By adopting the mindset that saving money is spending money, things like creating a [zero-based budget](http://brunchbucks.com/budget/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/) become significantly easier. I believe this happens because it forces us to limit the amount of spending money we have. Imagine picking up a box of chocolates with the intent of only eating one or two chocolates. Instead of the box being almost empty, you pleasantly realize you actually have an abundance of chocolates! You consume a handful since you have extra to spare.

Money often operates in the same way. With today's online banking it's easy to monitor your account balances with a few strokes. If I have extra padding in the checkings account, I noticed I have a tendency to spend more. Shifting money into a savings account and leaving it for an emergency can work wonders. When you treat saved money as spent money, it becomes much easier to limit yourself from using it in the future.
