We all know it's a good idea to save money, but it's hard enough to put some aside when we're already trying to foot the bills, hanging out with friends, and buying everyday life necessities. There are plenty of times when I tried to portion away cash that was intended for savings, but by the end of the month it all evaporated into thin air. Humans are fickle things, and simply saying we're going to do something doesn't always translate to it actually happening.

I'm a firm believer that if we want to **deeply** change our behavior, we first need to change how we think. A savings orientated mindset understands that "saved money is the same as spent money."

### But wait, that makes no sense!
It's easiest to imagine it as money that has been saved is the same as you paying for something right now. The only caveat is that you can pull this money out in the future and there could be more or there could be less cash available. Unfortunately, many people think of saved money and unspent money as the same thing. While the two are similar in that they both refer to unused funds in the bank account, the mental approach is drastically different. Let's look at some examples where a mindset that doesn't distinguish between the two manifests itself.

**_Shoppers fall for a common sales trap when they see big discounts on expensive items._**

Let's say there's a new pair of designer shoes you've been itching to buy for months. At first release the price tag is a whopping 200 bucks! Being the smart saver you are, you stave off purchasing them until they drop to an affordable $150. From there it's easy to think, wow I saved myself $150. However, the reality is that we still spent $150 more then spending no money at all.

**_Another tactic used by shopping malls are "buy one get one free" inventory sales._**

Similar to our shoe example, there's a difference between money spent compared to none at all. Studies have shown that sales tactics like "buy one hat get another free" push people to buy an extra article of clothing they ordinarily wouldn't buy. It's no surprise that holiday season is one of the most profitable sales period despite having yearly Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas holiday discounts. Vendors prey on the belief that unspent money directly translates savings.

### Some immediate actions
To convert discounts into savings, try taking the money saved and putting it into a savings account instead. The $50 shoes you paid for? Deliberately move the discounted $150 into an account where you're less likely to touch it. The extra "free" hat? Take the money from the unspent hat and stash it in another account. By moving extra funds we're treating saved money as spent money.

There's a lot of wisdom in the words "time is money". I like to think of savings as **spending money now, for the future.** I find this concept closely related to investing. Investing is similar to saving money because we are spending money that we can access in the future. The one caveat is that in the future, we may have more or less money.

Conversely, **spending money from the future, for now** is the concept behind tapping into your credit. Whenever we tap into our credit cards we're borrowing money from our future selves for today's purchases! And much like investments can translate to earning more money in the future, credit can translate to spending more money through interest.

By adopting the mindset that saving money is spending money, creating a [zero-based budget](http://brunchbucks.com/budgeting/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips.html), seeing the value in investments, and the importance of good credit become significantly easier. I believe this happens because it forces us to creatively think about the amount of spending money we actually have. Imagine picking up a box of chocolates with the intent of only eating a few chocolates. We pleasantly realize we actually have way more chocolate then we originally thought! We end up indulging (don't get me wrong, there is a time and place for splurging as well) in more chocolates then we originally intended.

Money often operates in the same way. With today's online checking accounts it's easy to check up on our account balances with just a few key strokes. If my checkings account is fatter than usual (e.g. right after payday) I notice I have a tendency to loosen up the wallet, even though in reality I'm earning the same amount everyday anyways. Shifting money into a savings account and waiting for a true crisis (loss of income, accident, medical emergency) works wonders for financial self-confidence and mental security. When we treat saved money as spent money, it becomes much easier to limit ourselves from using it frivolously in the future.
