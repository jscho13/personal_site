A lot of us know it's a good idea to save money for retirement, but fewer have a solid game plan in place on how to begin saving. Below is a useful flowchart that shows where we should put our money once we've hit certain money milestones.

### Emergency Funds
The first money milestone is to establish an emergency fund of 3-6 months *minimum* expenses. As you can guess, emergency funds should only be used to cover major financial gaps. They act like your lifeboat if you get laid off, a relative calls trying to scrape together bail out, or a medical sudden emergency strikes. It can quickly become the difference between peace of mind and high financial stress. While the number of months worth of cash is variable, it's important to note that it can take longer than three months to find a full time job. Other circumstances such as high interest debt (over 4%) can also justify having less than three months savings.

### Company 401k's
Larger companies may offer a company match up to a percentage of your annual salary (e.g. 5%). Maxing out this company match is second in order of precedence since it's essentially free money! Although not as common, some companies will have certain strings attached like a vesting schedule. A sample vesting schedule over four years is as follows:

- 1 year after employment the employee is 25% vested; the employee owns 25% of company contributions.
- 2 years after employment the employee is 50% vested; the employee owns 50% of contributions.
- 3 years after employment the employee owns 75% of company contributions.
- 4 years after employment the employee owns all of the companies contributions.

Vesting schedules effectively act like an incentive to keep employees within the company. But they also act as important safeguards for larger businesses who will have more employees coming in and out of the company.

### Debt
Tackling high interest debt comes after maxing employee matches. Ensuring minimum payments on all cards is important to mitigating excessive fees. From there, you can decide on which cards you'd like to pay down first. Most people choose to pay down the highest interest cards first, but Dave Ramsey made an alternative method of paying down credit debt: the snowball method.

For the **avalanche** method, debts are paid with the highest interest rates are paid off first. Balances with decreasing interest rates are paid off next. From a matmatical perspective this method makes the most financial sense. However, it can be daunting to tackle large credit card debt spread across multiple cards.

The **snowball** method addresses debts by balance size. With smaller balances are paid off first and larger balances next. While this method isn't financially optimal, it provides a strong sense of psychological control. Watching debts be paid off one by one gives a "tackling debt in baby steps" sort of feel. With each credit card that is paid in full the newly freed cash flow is a rewarding feeling.

### Retirement Vehicles: IRA + 401k
I've already written an overview of IRA's, 401k's and their nuances in [this](http://brunchbucks.com/retirement/2016/12/17/roth-vs-traditional.html) post. These retirement options are optimal because of the various tax benefits they provide. In general, IRA's are placed higher than 401k's because we have the flexibility of picking an IRA with a provider of our choice. There are particular cases where an employer offers especially strong 401k options (e.g. admiral shares of Vanguard funds, which have signficantly lower management fees). In these cases, placing 401k's above IRA's is acceptable.

### Savings/Investments
If you're fortunate enough to still have cash flow for further investments, you can begin planning for other goals. Some common options are looking into automated investors such as [Wealthfront](http://wlth.fr/1Hgmvnr){:rel="nofollow" alt="Wealthfront link"}, a backdoor Roth IRA if you're over the income limit, CDs, or a 529 college savings plan.
