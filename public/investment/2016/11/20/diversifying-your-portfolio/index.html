  <h1 class="post-title">Diversifying Your Portfolio</h1>
  <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2016</span>
  <p>The importance of diversifying your portfolio is a piece of advice every financial planner or individual investor will tell you at one point. Simply put, it’s the idea that you don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to your money. By organizing your cash into a mix of investments, there’s less at stake if a particular stock crashes.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-a-diversified-portfolio-look-like">What Does a Diversified Portfolio Look Like?</h3>
<p>A diverse portfolio contains a number of ingredients in the mix. Having a combination of bonds, short-term investments (i.e. CDs), foreign stocks, and U.S. stocks as a strong indicator of a well diversified portfolio.

<em>Source: <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/guide-to-diversification" rel="nofollow" alt="retirement fund comparison">fidelity</a></em></p>

<p>A general rule of thumb for stock percentage is 120 - your age, with the rest invested into bonds. For example, a 30 year old would have 90% stocks with 10% bonds. On the flip side, a 60 year old investor would have 60% stocks and 40% bonds.</p>

<h3 id="risk-tolerance">Risk Tolerance</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that according to the rule of thumb, the younger an investor is the more he invests in stocks. The concept of younger investors having more stock is called having a higher “risk tolerance”. Stocks are considered higher risk because they have greater fluctuations in their pricing. Conversely bonds are a more stable form of investment that risk-adverse investors seek to purchase. The reason for this is bonds have a lower return in exchange for a more stable value. It’s unlikely that a bonds value will crash since they are issued from the government or major corporations. Stocks have a higher chance of crashing since they are issued by companies.</p>

<p>There’s a great <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/stocks-versus-bonds/" rel="nofollow">video</a> by Investopedia that covers the differences between the two investment options, and why it’s important to have a mix of both in any portfolio. The gains from stocks can help cover the weaknesses of bonds, and vice versa.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-diversification">Types of Diversification</h3>
<p>Stocks and bonds are one type of diversification, but after digging into stocks you’ll find there are other types of diversification as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://smartermillennial.com/investment/2016/11/01/early-investing/">early investing</a> we covered the benefits of investing in index funds vs actively managed funds, and looked at the Vanguard 500 Index Fund in particular. <a href="http://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=VFINX" rel="nofollow">VFINX</a> is an excellent index fund because it instantly diversifies your portfolio across the 500 largest companies in America, how nice is that?</p>

<p>However, even within index funds are other types investments that can spread your net further. If we look at Morningstar’s nifty <a href="http://portfolio.morningstar.com/Rtport/Free/InstantXRayDEntry.aspx?ChangeMode=P&amp;entrynum=10&amp;productcode=" rel="nofollow">x-ray tool</a> we can see a whopping 99% of this fund is invested in U.S. Stocks. While the U.S. is generally growing, not all of the action is domestic. Investing in international stocks helps balance out the portfolio if the domestic value drops and international assets grow.</p>

<p>Furthermore, 86% of the fund is invested in large companies, and 14% is invested in medium sized companies. Balanced portfolios covers small, medium, and large companies alike. Even amongst these there growth, value, and core propositions. Simply put, growth propositions are stocks that are anticipated to grow quickly. Value propositions are stocks that are determined to be undervalued. In general, value propositions can be considered more safe compared to growth propositions. Last are core propositions. A core fund simply focuses on a mixture of growth and value stocks enough so that it can’t be categorized as either.</p>

<h3 id="tuning-your-portfolio">Tuning Your Portfolio</h3>
<p>It’s important to diversify portfolios because not all growth happens in one place. Factors to keep in mind is the size of the companies stock, whether it’s domestic or international, and and the type of investment. If you’ve covered all these bases you can begin to consider your portfolio well-rounded.</p>
