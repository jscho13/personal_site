  <h1 class="post-title">Diversifying Your Portfolio</h1>
  <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2016</span>
  <p>The importance of diversifying your portfolio is a piece of advice every financial planner or individual investor will tell you at one point. Simply put, it’s the idea that you don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to your money. By organizing your cash into a mix of investments, there’s less at stake if a particular stock crashes.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-a-diversified-portfolio-look-like">What Does a Diversified Portfolio Look Like?</h3>
<p>A diverse portfolio contains a number of ingredients in the mix. Having a combination of bonds, short-term investments (i.e. CDs), foreign stocks, and U.S. stocks as a strong indicator of a well diversified portfolio.

<p>One of the strongest factors in determining your portfolio is age. Younger investors have a higher risk tolerance because they have more time to bounce back from crashes. Older investors have a lower risk tolerance since they are closer to retirement. A general rule of thumb for stock percentage is 120 - your age with the rest into bonds. For example, a 30 year old would have 90% stocks, and 10% bonds.</p>

<p>NEXT: what is the difference between stocks and bonds in terms of risk?</p>

<h3 id="whys-it-useful">Why’s It Useful?</h3>
<p>A common mental trap with unfocused money is that it doesn’t necessarily turn into savings. While it’s possible to respect your budgets limit, it’s easy to squander unbudgeted money. Personally I noticed myself primed to spend more money in a category (let’s say dining out) even though I hit my limit of $400.</p>

<p>When there’s a little bit of extra padding it can be tempting to go over the limit, and money that could have been saved will quickly evaporate. However, once I slimmed down my spending and put it towards better <a href="http://smartermillennial.com/investment/2016/11/01/early-investing/">investments</a>, I found myself starting to consistently hit my budget.</p>

<p>There are studies that show zero-based budgeting can lead to a double win of paying off more debt, and saving more money! Creating a zero-based budget today goes a long way to paving a stable financial future.</p>

<h3 id="so-now-what">So now what?</h3>
<p>To properly create a zero-based budget gather all the sources of your annual income, whether it be from work, side gigs, or another business.</p>

<p>From there <strong>delegate every dollar</strong> to a job. Even if there’s $50 left over assign it to a specific category like Transportation or Shopping. Don’t stress on getting the numbers exactly right, as long as you have a general estimate. As more time passes and you accumulate more spending history it will become easier to assess how much you’ll spend.</p>

<p>If you already have a budget take time now to assess it and look for any gaps. Are there places you’ve where you spend more and or spend less? Not sure what to do with hard saved money? The job isn’t finished. Some common options are a savings account, building your nest egg, and 401k/IRA’s.</p>

  <p>There’s a big difference between unfocused money and money that goes straight towards savings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creating an initial plan for <a href="http://smartermillennial.com/budget/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/">your first budget</a> can seem intimidating, vut going over and under (if you’re lucky!) budget always happens. A last note is that while budgets initially seem constricting in how much you spend, they gradually become liberating. Once you start to follow your budget you won’t feel guilty for occasionally splurging your hard-earned money since you know it’s within your limits.</p>
