<p>One of the earliest barriers to getting started on investing is figuring out where to start. While its true that there’s a wealth of knowledge involved in investments, there are simple ways to get your best bang for buck early on. All you need to begin your investment is purchasing <a href="http://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=VFINX" rel="nofollow">Vanguard 500 Index Funds</a>. It’s a good fund to start with because it index funds are considered passive (versus an active fund).</p>

<p>Index funds consistently outperform any active fund for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They have lower management fees.</li>
  <li>They trade much less, so turnover ratio is lower.</li>
</ul>

<p>Countless evidence proves time and time again index funds are more favorable then active funds. In addition to the main two points, other causes of poor performance include human error. There are plenty of poor portfolio managers out there, not all of them are perfect. Enthusiasts check portfolio manager histories before purchasing any of a portfolio managers shares. Even after funding a manager however, it’s possible they will switch over to another portfolio to leave you in the dust.</p>

<p>Index funds are considered passive funds because their portfolios mirror the market index. In our case, the Vanguard 500 Index Mutual Fund (<a href="http://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=VFINX" rel="nofollow">VFINX</a>) follows the Standard and Poor’s 500. Essentially whenever you buy a stock of if VFINX, you’re buying a tiny fraction of the 500 largest companies in America.</p>

<h3 id="paying-less-is-earning-more">Paying Less Is Earning More</h3>
<p>John C. Bogle is a famous investor best known for his low cost portfolios that paid off in longer time horizons. He’s considered a top investor among the ranks of Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, and Benjamin Graham. His investment strategy can be summarized as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You get exactly what you don’t pay for.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>His point especially drives home how important it is to have low management fees with consistent performance over time. Actively managed funds have trouble beating a low-cost index fund especially after accounting for the higher fees in active funds. Below is a graph that draws out a Vanguard Fund with a yearly fee of 0.07% compared to a fund that runs for 1.32%. The total difference of 1.25% isn’t so big of a deal right?</p>

<p>Woah there. It turns out a whopping 27% of your potential retirement savings is lost when estimated over a 40 year period. The reason is the double whammy of losing money to fees, and on top of that losing the potential earnings of that hard earned cash. Don’t forget, countless resources prove that actively managed accounts have trouble beating index funds even before accounting for all the management fees.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>While it’s possible to get excellent returns in stock, most people simply don’t have the time to do their homework and look deep into their portfolios to actively maintain it. Skip paying exorbitantly high fees and start investing into Vanguard funds for simplicity and bang for buck. HR can help look into <a href="http://brunchbucks.com/credit/2016/10/28/managing-credit-score/">401k or Roth 401k’s</a> and other investment options. If your employer doesn’t offer any matches, consider opening an IRA instead. Once you’ve started your path towards a stable financial future and you’re ready to take another step, dive deeper into investments by learning more about the importance of <a href="http://brunchbucks.com/investment/2016/11/16/diversifying-your-portfolio/">diversifying your portfolio</a>.</p>
