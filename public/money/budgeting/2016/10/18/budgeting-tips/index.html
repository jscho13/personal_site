<p>One of the key tricks to effective budgeting is making sure you budget every dollar, also known as a zero-based budget.</p>

<p>A common mental trap is believing unbudgeted money will automatically go into savings. While it’s possible to respect your budgets limit, psychologically it’s easy use the extra as a crutch. I found the brain is primed to spend more on top of going over budget when all of your money isn’t tasked! Saving leftovers can be difficult, and you may find the leftover 200 dollars that were for your savings can quickly turn into some extra spending money.</p>

<p>In my early 20’s I made the critical mistake of not giving every dollar a job. I would convince myself it’s okay to spend a little bit more since I always had that extra cash padding. I would love to splurge on concert tickets, alcohol, and things to keep the party going. The extra cash that I thought would go into my savings would disappear like magic. Once I nailed down my extra cash towards better <a href="http://money.josephscho.com/money/beginners-guide-to-investing">investments</a>, I found myself consistently hitting my budget.</p>

<h3 id="so-now-what">So now what?</h3>
<p>Take time now to assess your budget and look at any gaps. Have money you haven’t budgeted yet? The job isn’t finished. Some common options are a savings account, a <a href="http://money.josephscho.com/money/building-a-nest-egg">nest egg</a>, or 401k/IRA’s. There’s a big difference between money though of as unbudgeted “savings” versus money goes specifically towards savings.</p>

<p>Going over and under (if you’re lucky!) budget happens all the time. No one can predict their monthly spending on the dot. But making sure all of your money is going somewhere goes a long way in your path to building wealth. Going over and under your budget is natural, but knowing all of your money has a delegated task goes a long way to keeping you focused and preventing overspending.</p>
