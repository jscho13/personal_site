<p>One of the key tricks to effective budgeting is making sure you budget every dollar.</p>

<p>You may be thinking “doesn’t my leftover cash just go to my savings”? While it’s very possible you fulfill your budget and successfully save your leftovers, psychologically it’s easy to tack the extra in back of your head. That leftover 200 that was supposed to go into your savings can quickly turn into a buffer for extra spending!</p>

<p>Before I used to budget every dollar I and I hit my cap, I would silently think to myself it’s okay to spend a little bit more, after all I still have that extra unbudgeted padding. Frequent cashflow sucks in my books were concert tickets and eating out. The extra cash that I thought would go into my savings would evaporate into thin air as I would tack on extra show here and another dinner there. Once I hammered down my extra cash as critical money that would go towards <a href="http://money.josephscho.com/beginners-guide-to-investing">investments</a>, I became far more hesitant to push my limits more.</p>

<h3 id="so-now-what">So now what?</h3>
<p>Take time now to assess your budget and think of where you can put your excess money. The job isn’t finished just yet. Some common options are a savings account, a <a href="http://money.josephscho.com/building-a-nest-egg">nest egg</a>, or another account for a big purchase such as plane tickets out of the country. Of course, this is once all the common expenses are out of the way and you’re on your way to <a href="http://money.josephscho.com/building-wealth">building real wealth</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, going over and under (if you’re lucky!) budget happens all the time. If someone out there can predict their spending to the dot a month in advance they’re rather eerie in my book. But making sure all of your money is going somewhere goes a long way in your path to building wealth. It’s also commonly called zero-based-budgeting, check it out. Going over and under your budget is natural, but knowing all of your money has a delegated task goes a long way to keeping you focused and preventing overspending.</p>
