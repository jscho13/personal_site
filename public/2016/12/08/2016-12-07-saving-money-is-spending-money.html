<p>We all know it’s a good idea to save money, but how do we exactly going about doing it?</p>

<p>It’s hard enough to save money while trying to juggle bills, going out, and buying necessities. Have you ever set aside money that was supposed to be for savings, but by the end of the month the money you had planned to have leftover is no longer there? A key paradigm that helped savings dramatically is that “saving money is the same as spending money.”</p>

<h3 id="but-wait-hows-that-possible">But wait, how’s that possible?</h3>
<p>A common mindset people share is the idea that saving money is the same as not spending money. Unfortunately this isn’t necessarily true, and therein the lies the trap of savings.</p>

<p>Shoppers justify spending by believing money not spent directly translates to money saved. Let’s say theres a new pair of Nike’s you’ve been itching to buy for months. At first release the price tag is a whopping $300! Being the clever spender you are, you stave off purchasing them until they drop to a much more affordable $250. It’s easy to think, wow I saved myself $50! The reality is that you still spent $250 more compared to buying no shoes at all.</p>

<p>Another tactic used by shopping malls is buy two get one free “discounts”. Just because you received three pairs of pants doesn’t mean you saved money. You still spent the amount of money you paid for the jeans. It’s no surprise that holiday season is one of the most profitable sales period for retail stores, despite having numerous Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Christmas sales. These examples clearly demonstrate that there’s a distinct difference between money saved and money not spent.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-does-this-all-mean">So what does this all mean?</h3>
<p>To really translate discounts into savings, try taking the money saved and putting it into your savings. The $50 you saved on your shoes? Put them into your savings. The extra pair of jeans you received? Take that cash and act like you spent it anyways.</p>

<p>Instead, try to imagine savings as <strong>spending money now, for the future.</strong> Using slightly fancier financial terminology, spending money now the future is the same as making <a href="http://brunchbucks.com/investing/2016/11/01/early-investing.html">investments</a>. Conversely, <strong>spending money from your future, for the present</strong> is the same as credit. There’s a lot of wisdom in the words “time is money”.</p>

<p>By adopting the mindset that saving money is spending money, things like creating a <a href="http://brunchbucks.com/moneymanagement/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/">zero-based budget</a> become significantly easier. I believe this happens because it forces us to realize we have less money than we have. Imagine picking up a box of chocolates with the intent of only eating one or two more. Instead of the box being almost empty, you pleasantly realize you actually have an abundance of chocolate. You happily consume more than you intended because you have extra to spare.</p>

<p>Savings can operate in the same way. When we check out account balances and are pleasantly surprised there’s a little more padding then we expected, we have a tendency to spend more. A method I use is shifting unspent money to a separate savings account, almost as if I spent it. Through this it becomes clear saving money is the same as spending money, but on your financial future.</p>
