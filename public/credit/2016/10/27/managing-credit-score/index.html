  <h3 id="whats-it-good-for-anyways">What’s It Good For Anyways?</h3>
<p>Think of your credit score like your GPA except for money. Lenders such as banks, credit card companies, and dealerships determine your qualification for loans and interest rates based on your credit score. A strong credit score could translate to thousands of dollars in savings, or thousands of dollars in losses! Know your credit score is part of the picture especially during major financial decisions, like buying a house or getting a new car.</p>

<h3 id="credit-score-factors">Credit Score Factors</h3>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.credit.com/credit-scores/what-does-fico-stand-for-and-what-is-a-fico-credit-score/" rel="nofollow">number of factors</a> to your credit score. The below is the exact breakdown for FICO. While other credit rating agencies exist, they pretty much follow a similar algorithm to determine what your credit score should be. The factors are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payment history - (35%)</li>
  <li>Credit Utilization (Total debt owed) - (30%)</li>
  <li>Length of credit history (15%)</li>
  <li>Amount of New Credit/Inquiries (10%)</li>
  <li>Credit mix (10%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the single biggest thing you can do to pat yourself on the back is making sure you pay your bills on time! Forgetting to pay a bill is a double whammy of additional fees and credit damage, so automatic payment features go a long way to ensure bills are paid on time.</p>

<h3 id="credit-utilization">Credit Utilization</h3>
<p>The second largest influence to credit rating is your total debt owed versus maximum credit, also known as credit utilization. Utilization is calculated by the the total debt owed vs your credit limit. If you have a total debt of $2,000 and a credit limit of $8,000 your credit utilization is 25%.

<h3 id="gaming-the-system">Gaming the System</h3>
<p>In general, creditors like to see a utilization less than 35%. Luckily for us, there are a few tricks you can use to game the credit system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you’ve been with a credit card for a year or more aggressively ask for a credit score increase. Companies aren’t afraid to give credit as long as you have a strong history with them. Note that credit limits can be retrograded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apply for credit cards if you haven’t had any recent hard inquiries. Credit increases are good for three reasons. A. It lowers utilization (compare $500/$1000 vs $500/$1500) B. It diversifies the credit mix. Having a mix of cards, loans, and mortgages tells lenders you’re a responsible creditor.  C. It’s not considered a hard pull. Why say no to a free higher limit?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="some-caveats-to-keep-in-mind">Some Caveats to Keep In Mind</h3>
<p>Staying aggressive early on especially helps because longer credit history directly translates to a higher score. While cards can shut down after a period of time, using a card at least once a year keeps you in the safe zone. Do not ask for more credit cards if you’ve had more than four hard pulls within a two year period! A high number of inquiries is considered suspicious activity because you may be desperately shopping around for credit.</p>

<p>Having a solid grasp on credit important, but it’s also important to <a href="http://brunchbucks.com/moneymanagement/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/">budget</a> existing money as well. The two often go hand in hand as credit leverages future spending, and budgeting determines current spending.</p>
