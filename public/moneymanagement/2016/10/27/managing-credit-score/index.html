<p>Credit scores are an important tool for determining your qualification and interest rates on loans. It could mean thousands of dollars in savings. Whenever you make a major financial decision, like buying a house or getting a new car, your credit score will be part of the picture.</p>

<h3 id="credit-score-factors">Credit Score Factors</h3>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.credit.com/credit-scores/what-does-fico-stand-for-and-what-is-a-fico-credit-score/">number of factors</a> to your credit score.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payment history - (35%)</li>
  <li>Credit Utilization (Total debt owed) - (30%)</li>
  <li>Length of credit history (15%)</li>
  <li>Amount of New Credit/Inquiries (10%)</li>
  <li>Credit mix (10%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the single biggest thing you can do for yourself is paying your bills on time. Forgetting to pay a bill is a double whammy of additional fees and credit damage. Automatic payments go a long way to ensure bills are paid on time.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-cheat-the-credit-system">How to Cheat The Credit System</h3>
<p>The second largest impact is credit utilization, which is calculated by the the total debt owed vs your credit limit. If you have a debt of $500 and a credit limit of $1000 ($500/$1000), your credit limit is 50%. Creditors like to see a utilization less than 35%. Luckily for us, there are a few tricks you can use to game the credit system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>After you’ve been with a credit card for a year or more you ask for a credit score increase.</li>
  <li>Apply aggressively for credit cards if you haven’t had any recent hard inquiries.</li>
</ol>

<p>Credit increases are good for two reasons. A. They lowers your utilization ($500/$1000 vs $500/$1500) B. It’s not considered a hard pull.</p>

<p>Applying aggressively helps because older credit cards translate directly to longer credit history. These cards typically don’t shut down if you use them once a year. Remember, having too many credit pulls within a two year period impacts your score.</p>

<p>Having a solid handle on credit important, but it’s also important to <a href="http://money.josephscho.com/moneymanagement/2016/10/19/budgeting-tips/">budget</a> your existing money as well. The two often go hand in hand as credit leverages future spending, and budgeting determines current spending.</p>
