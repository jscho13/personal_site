Keeping our wallets closed on impulsive buys is an important skill, but changing our habits accordingly is tougher. When it comes to changing how I act, no amount of tips and techniques really sticks until I change how I approach my goal. For example, going to the gym regularly is a healthy habit, but did you know exercising regularly also improves your cognitive function? It wasn't until I read the book Spark by John Ratey that I realized exercise isn't just a chore I should be doing, it's also a cheat code to help me learn faster and remember better. By viewing exercise in another lens I began to think "I'm helping myself become smarter by exercising" instead of "I'm going to exercise because I'm supposed to".

Being a smart spender is no exception. Understanding why we're spending too much is key to changing our spending habits. I believe a lot of us today are trapped in a **Consumer mindset**.

### Ways We're Geared Towards a Consumer Mindset
For me a consumer mindset is another way to describe our need to spend more money on things we don't need. The lines between want and need become easily blurred because of how our peers and society in generally has shaped how we think. Take the perceived value of a watch for example.

While originally watches were a tool help us keep track of time, they've turned into something that represents much more than their original function. Watches now function less as a tool, and more of an accessory for us to show off our status and fashion taste. Someone wearing a Rolex watch gives off the impression of wealth since they're so expensive, even though they might have broken the bank to purchase one! At the end of the day if we really wanted to check the time a simple battery powered Casio watch would do. In the age of smartphones where we always have access to the time watches have become even more unnecessary. We've essentially socially engineered ourselves with good marketing to create a perceived value watches! Our justification of the iconic value of watches over the actual utility it provides is a classic example of a consumer mindset.

Presenting ourselves in certain social settings with the need to fit in is another way consumer mindsets manifest themselves.

In the world of online dating where meeting singles is easier than ever dating can quickly add up. While it's not a written rule, there's a subtle pressure for men to pay for the first date. Media influences our perception that men should pay up first to be more attractive, capable of caring, and not a cheapskate. Clothes is another example of how societal norms influence us to buy more than we might need. Gym clothes, relaxing clothes, business casual clothes, and the variety of shoes we wear for different occasions aren't necessary but are generally viewed as standard. Gym clothes to a meeting, or a suit to some casual lunch isn't considered appropriate fashion-wise, even though all we need to be sure of is not be naked. Mark Zuckerberg is humorously known for walking into venture capitalist meetings in a t-shirt and flip-flops. Everyday we face pressures to look or dress a certain way, but when examined with a closer lens is completely necessary.

A third value I believe most consumer orientated mindsets share is the desire to impress others.

There's nothing wrong with wanting to look good, but I see this mindset often particularly in New York City. NYC is one of the densest cities in the world. The richest among us share the same streets as the homeless. The irony of Manhattan is the excessive amounts of cash people spend on housing for the sake of image. Because of its density, each square foot has an inflated premium relative to the rest of the States. Where you live can speak volumes about how much you earn, your level of success in life, and standard of education. Manhattanites spend more on housing than anywhere else except for San Francisco because of this.

### Practical Applications
Once I realized a lot of extraneous spending I do is to impress others instead of making myself happier, I began to realize how fruitless the entire venture was. Taking this advice to heart and applying it to my everyday life is easier said than done and remains a constant work in progress.

Here are some techniques I've heard from friends or applied myself.

**$20 technique:**
Using only cash is a known for reducing spending. There's something about physically letting go of money that turns it from a vague number to something physical that you're losing. A friend told me an idea where he only used $20 dollar bills for purchases. The rest of the bill would be saved as cash. For him, $20's became a far more valuable bill not because of it's monetary value, but because of how many bills he had left. It mad him think twice before breaking a bill. Another perk was seeing the savings in cash by the end of the month. Accumulating a large number of smaller bills felt like he saved money and an end of the month reward.

**Managing credit cards:**
Credit card bonuses are on the other side of the spectrum. By taking advantage of sign up bonuses I've earned hundreds of dollars worth of credits and cash back. For example, American Express Premier Rewards Gold Card provides a 25,000 point sign-up bonus after spending $2,000 within the first three months. That amounts to $125 cash back or up to $250 worth of gift cards. Credit cards are a double edged sword however. Entering the world of cashless spending can turn purchases into numbers on a screen. It's easier to spend more when you don't see $100 leaving your wallet, but letting go of five $20's feels a lot more painful to part with.

**Practice being thankful:**
This last bit attempts to address the root problem of having a consumer mindset. Personally, by appreciating the things I have more I'm less likely to want other things. [Tim Ferriss's podcast](http://tim.blog/2014/05/06/the-tim-ferriss-podcast-episode-4-ryan-holiday/){:rel="nofollow"} talks about how there are two ways to achieve the point of have everything you want:
  1. You can increase the things you have
  2. You can decrease the things you want

Most of the time we want things for thing wrong reasons. We want to impress others, present ourselves in a certain way, or succumb to an impulse buy for an awesome experience we just "can't miss out on". Our smartphones, laptops, cars, furniture, apartment, etc. are all large purchases that are perfectly fine but could always be a bit nicer. The next hot thing is always around the corner, and pushes us to continue buy more when most of us are lucky enough to already have everything we really need.
