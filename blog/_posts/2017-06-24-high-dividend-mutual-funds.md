A friend of mine mentioned making faster money off the stock market by investing in high dividend mutual funds. These funds target companies which give money back to their investors in the form of [dividends](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp){:rel="nofollow"}, and boast a return that even out performs the S&P 500! I had to look into high dividend mutual funds after hearing about them. Are they really worth the money? And if they were such a good investment why wasn't everyone buying into it?

### Pros and cons for high dividend mutual funds

if your goal is pure capital appreciation
its better to not dabble in dividends
and stick with pure equities
or sorry not pure equities, but growth stocks
2 reasons why (and i'm not the complete authority on this)
1. if a company has enough cash to make dividends, then that means management believes that there are not enough investment opportunities for the company to make an attractive return on investment, so they return the cash to shareholders so they can figur eout what to do with it
because of this phenomenon, by definition, high dividend stocks are generally used for the income and not the growth in stock value
2. taxes. when you hold a growth stock and it grows in value, that appreciation is not taxed until you sell the stock. that value is then kept in the investment, and allowed to grow and compound. with high dividend stocks, you pay taxes on that cash flow stream
so if you reinvest that dividend, you're doing it on an after-tax basis
if you just held a growth stock, the value would grow and you pay taxes on the exit
